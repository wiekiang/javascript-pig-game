# The Pig Game: A JavaScript DOM Manipulation Adventure

I stumbled across an enthralling journey through the winding maze of **JavaScript**, complete with all of its quirks and intricacies. But don't worry, my efforts will be rewarded with the opportunity to participate in the delightful pig game - a veritable feast for the senses and the mind!

Let me explain the nature of this game. This JavaScript is intended to manipulate the **Document Object Model (DOM)** for users to enjoy a game of strategy. The pig game will put your wits to the test as you compete against another user in a titanic battle of wits.

What exactly is this pig game, you may wonder? Here's a quick rundown of the game's rules and mechanics: two players, you and your friend, will take turns rolling a six-sided die. Each roll adds to your current score, but if you roll a 1, you lose all of your points for that turn! The first player to reach a predetermined score threshold (the default is 100 points) wins this game of wits and luck.

The algorithm's flowchart is as follows:

> May your adventures in the world of JavaScript be fruitful and plentiful, and may the swine always be on your side.
